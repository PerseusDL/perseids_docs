{"name":"Perseids Project Developer Documentation","tagline":"Developer Documentation for Perseids","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\n[Perseids](http://sites.perseids.tufts.edu) is an [online platform](http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol) for collaborative editing, annotation and publication of digital texts and annotations. Perseids is not one single application but an integrated environment built from a loose coupling of heterogeneous tools and services from a variety of sources using RESTful APIs, and supporting various standard formats for encoding of text and annotations. Supported standards include, but arenâ€™t limited to, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Open Annotation (OA).  The platform also supports cross-project collaboration, where content might come from a separate project, be edited through Perseids and then returned to its source repository.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Links\r\n\r\n[Integration Documentation](https://github.com/PerseusDL/perseids_docs/blob/master/integrations/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Mailing Lists\r\n\r\n[perseids-dev@elists.tufts.edu](https://elist.tufts.edu/wws/info/perseids-dev)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors \r\n@balmas \r\n@caesarfeta\r\n@lfdm\r\n@srdee\r\n@lichtr\r\n@christof\r\n@lcerrato\r\n@annakrohn\r\n@AlisonBabeu\r\n\r\n### Funders\r\nThis project has received support from the [Andrew W.
