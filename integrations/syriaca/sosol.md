# SoSOL Implementation Details for Syriaca.org

## Perseids and SoSOL
The Perseids platform is composed a network of loosely coupled tools and services.  The Syriaca.org/Perseids integration relies only upon 2 of components of the Perseids platform: SoSOL and [Flask GitHub Proxy](flaskgithubproxy.md).

SoSOL is a Ruby on Rails application backed by Git and mySQL that was originally written for the Papyri.info project and extended by Perseids for its own use.  As of the time of this writing, the Perseids main line of development on SoSOL can be found in the ['perseids-production'](https://github.com/sosol/sosol/tree/perseids-production) branch of the SoSOL git repository. Eventually the Perseids changes may be merged back into the master branch. We try to keep the perseids-production branch up to date with the changes made to master to facilitate this eventuality.

## Data Model
### Publications and Identifiers
Data publications produced on SoSOL are collections of related data objects of different types. The _Publication_ is the container for a collection of data objects belonging to a parent abstract class of _Identifier_. Different type object types are implemented as derivations of the _Identifier_ class, which add type-specific behaviors and properties, such as schema validation rules.

For Syriaca.org we have added 3 new _Identifier_ derived classes to SoSOL:

_SyriacaIdentifier_ - For Gazetteer Records

_SyriacaPersonIdentifier_ - For Biographical Dictionary Records

_SyriacaWorkIdentifier_ - For Hagiographic Work Records

The _SyriacaPersonIdentifier_ and _SyriacaWorkIdentifier_ classes are themselves derivations of the base _Syriaca_ class, inheriting all behaviors, overriding only descriptive attributes and the path used when sending data to the remote Syriaca.org GitHub repository.

The class diagram below shows the methods and attributes that the _SyriacaIdentifier_ class overrides from the base _Identifier_ class.

The _SyriacaIdentifier_ class delegates the process of validating the TEI XML documents to JRubyXML:SyriacaGazetteerValidator. This class specifies the location of the RNG schema used to validate the documents and uses a Saxon processor to perform the validation. The RNG schema used to validate the Syriaca documents is used directly from its location on GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srophe/srophe-eXist-app/master/srophe-app/documentation/syriaca-tei-main.rng. This allows the Syriaca.org team to update this schema as needed without requiring any update to the Perseids SoSOL environment.

### Boards and Communities

The SoSOL review workflow is built around two main model classes: _Communities_ and _Boards_.  Perseids' enhancements to the core SoSOL functionality have extended the base _Community_ class into 3 types of derived classes: _MasterCommunity_, _PassThroughCommunity_ and _EndUserCommunity_. Community types differ in what happens to a publication after it has been finalized by the final _Board_ in the community. The _MasterCommunity_ commits its finalized publications to the master branch of the Git repository that is local to the SoSOL platform.  The _EndUserCommunity_ sends its finalized publications to a specified User, who then can edit and submit the publication under their own account. The _PassThroughCommunity_ can either send its finalized publications to an external repository, via an HTTP API call, or to another SoSOL community. The Syriaca.org integration with Perseids uses PassThroughCommunities that are setup to send their finalized publications to the external Syriaca.org Git Repository (https://github.com/srophe/srophe-app-data) via the [FlaskGitHub Proxy](flaskgithubproxy.md). 

Communities can be setup to be self-signup communities or closed communities. Closed communities require that an admin assign individual users as members of the community before they can submit publications to it.  Because the list of users who may be submitting to the [Syriaca.org communities](apioauth.md#syriacaorg-communities) is open-ended, the Syriaca.org communities are configured to be self-signup, meaning that any user can submit to them.  

There is only one type of Board model class in SoSOL. A Board has one or more user members and is associated with one or more classes of Identifier.  When a user submits a Publication to a Community it is sent to the lowest ranked Board that is associated with the class of the individual Identifier documents in the publication. Board members submit _Votes_ on individual publications by selecting a _Decrees_ associated with an _approve_ or _reject_ action. The Decree has a _tally_method_ which can be set to either an absolute number of votes or a percentage of total members. When the tally of votes received for a publication meets the threshold set for a decree it moves to the appropriate next stage in the workflow. (If it's rejected it returns to the submitting user, if it's approved, it moves on to the finalization stage).   

Several new configurable features were added to the Board model class to support the Syriaca.org workflow. These are described below.  All of these features can be configured on Boards by community admin users only.

#### Board Member Assignment 
The default behavior when a publication is sent to a board is that any member of the Board can see and vote on the publication.  A new configurable boolean property added for Syriaca.org, _requires_assignment_, can be used to restrict visibility and voting on Board publications to only those members who have been actively assigned to vote on the publication by a community admin. New user interface elements were added to the boards views to enable community admins to assign and unassign members to publications.   A separate setting, _max_assignable_ can be used to set the maximum number of members who can be assigned to vote on an individual publication. This number can be more or less than the number of votes needed to trigger a decree action.  

#### Default Finalizer
When a publication receives enough approve votes to trigger the approval Decree action it moves to the finalization stage. At this stage the publication can receive final edits before it passes out of the control of the Board. The default behavior of the application is to assign a Finalizer at random from among the Board members.  A new property added for Syriaca.org, _finalizer_user_id_ enables a community admin to designate a specific Board member to be assigned as the finalizer for all publicatios approved by the Board. (In fact, a placeholder for this feature was already present in the code, it just hadn't been fully implemented before this). 

#### Skip Finalization
In the normal SoSOL workflow, once a Publication has approved by a Board and finalized, all the Identifiers which were under that Board's control are considered complete and no further action can be taken on them in the community (i.e. they go on to the next step as appropriate for the type of community, as described above).  The Syriaca.org workflow required a multi-stage Board approval process, with one Board serving as a gatekeeper to determine an appropriate sub board for an initial vote on a publication, followed by final approval and potential editing before finalization and acceptance back to the Syriaca.org GitHub repository.  To support this we added a new _skip_finalize_ boolean property. Once a Publication is approved by a Board with this flag set to true, as long as there is another viable candidate Board for the Publication to go to (i.e one in the same community which is associated with the class of the approved Identifier) then the Publication will not be finalized and instead will just be sent to the next Board.  To further support this, workflow, we added a new _next_board_ property on the Publication model class, and the ability for a Voting member to explicitly state which Board the publication should be assigned to next. 

#### Decree Rules
The final new feature we added to the Board functionality for Syriaca.org was the ability for additional _Rules_ to be added to Decrees which can be used to force a publication on to the next stage in the workflow even if a Decree action hasn't been fully met. We implemented basic Rules which have two properties: _floor_ and an _expire_days_. In ordre for a Rule to apply for a Decree, the publicaiton must have received at least the number of votes for the decree as specified in the Rule _floor_ and at least _expire_days_ must have passed with no voting activity on the Publication.  For example, if a Decree is set to require 5 votes, with a Rule which has a floor of 2 votes and expire_days set to 30, then the Rule can apply if at least 30 days have passed since the last vote was received and at least 2 votes for the Decree have been made.

However, Rules are not automatically applied. They require an active _ApplyRules_ action to be performed by a community admin for the Board.  This can be done through a button on the Boards display, visible only to community admins. It could potentially also be setup to run as a cron job, although it would require an authenticated user session for this to work properly.
