# Instructions for adding new content to Perseids

## Adding a new CITE collection

1. Find the top level folder for the collection in the canonical repo (naming convention is `CITE_<TYPE>_<FORMAT>` e.g. `CITE_ALIGNMENT_XML`, `CITE_OA_XML`, etc.

2. Create a subfolder path named according the following convention: `<namespace prefix>/<collection name>` e.g. `perseus/pdlcomm`

3. Add a readme to this folder

4. Commit to the canonical repo.
