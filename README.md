### Overview

[Perseids](http://sites.perseids.tufts.edu) is an [online platform](http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol) for collaborative editing, annotation and publication of digital texts and annotations. Perseids is not one single application but an integrated environment built from a loose coupling of heterogeneous open source tools and services from a variety of sources using RESTful APIs, and supporting various standard formats for encoding of text and annotations. Supported standards include, but arenâ€™t limited to, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Open Annotation (OA).  The platform also supports cross-project collaboration, where content might come from a separate project, be edited through Perseids and then returned to its source repository.

The main user entrypoint to the platform is at https://sosol.perseids.org/sosol.

Administrative entrypoints are described at [admin.md](admin.md)
